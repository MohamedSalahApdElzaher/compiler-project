**This is our compiler course project**
## Here is the description of the project:

- Build a dynamic code analyzer for Java Language to generate statement and branches code coverage reports.
-  Kindly refer to this stackoverflow link to know the difference between statement and branch coverage: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14519416/a-difference-between-statement-and-decision-coverage#:~:text=Statement%20coverage%20is%20said%20to,true%20branches%20will%20be%20executed.
- To warm you up, check the expected output of the project that you are expected to deliver at the end of the project:

Were the green lines show the executed commands, and the red lines show the commands which are not executed when the program ran

## How to run the program ? 
1- make the clone of the repo.
2- open the folder of the repo on an ide such as intelliJ.
3- download antlr-4.9.3 (jar file).
4- return to the ide then import the jar file to the project.
5- make sure that all modules are added to the project. 
6- run javaprogram.java.
7- the output will be shown in created files text/output.txt (the blocks covered by the test program) and html/output.html (green color for blocks which is visited and red color for unvisited blocks).
